'''Question: 
Write a Python program to convert a list to a tuple.
'''

# Python code: 

>>> #Convert list to tuple
>>> listx = [5, 10, 7, 4, 15, 3]
>>> print(listx)
>>> #use the tuple() function built-in Python, passing as parameter the list
>>> tuplex = tuple(listx)
>>> print(tuplex)


'''Output sample:
